#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n) aka Linear
-- No matter how much N is increased or decreased the rate will remain the same.


b) 0(n^2) aka Quadratic 
-- Everytime you add to N the while loop has to run twice as many times


c) 0(n)
-- No matter how much 'bunnies' is increased or decreased the rate will remain the same.

## Exercise II

-- For this problem I would use a binary search - these will allow use to find `f` with the least amount of broken eggs.

-- We would create a function that took one peram ( n = int)
-- We would define three vars top, middle and bottom.
-- Top = n , middle = n //2, bottom = 0

-- next create a loop built with a range top
-- if the egg breaks we reassign top to be middle and recurs
-- if the egg doesn't break we increatement the bottom upwarsds
-- we countinue this until we the middle is one digit apart from the top and bottom.

-- We do this so we will know the highest floor we can drop the egg from without it breaking. 

# THEN WE GO NUTS AND DROP ALL OF THE EGGS!
